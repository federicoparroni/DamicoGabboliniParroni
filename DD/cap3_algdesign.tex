\chapter{Algorithmic Design}
In this chapter are given the guidelines on how to implement the most important functionalities that the components of the system will offer. The pseudocode of the relevant method is shown. 

\section{Login}
The Login involves the application the application server and the database. The last one is located outside the application server. 
To login in to the application the following steps must be done:
\begin{enumerate}
\item the user presses the Login button in the Login view;
\item the Identity manager (Login method) sends a request to the Application Server for authentication
\item A query on the database is performed to check the validity of the user credential and a response to the client is returned;
\end{enumerate}

Login(username, password)
	response = SendRequest("api/login", username, password)
	if response.isValid 
		token = response.GetToken
		Show(HomeView)
	else
		Show(ErrorMessage , "Invalid Credentials")

LoginRequest(username, password)
	result = database.query(username, password)
	if result == 1
		SendAuthenticationResponse (token)
	else
		sendAuthenticationError(error code)
