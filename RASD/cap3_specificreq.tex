\chapter{Specific requirements}

\section{External Interface Requirements}
The application shows its best potential when run in a mobile device, for instance a smartphone or a tablet. This permits to extend the features and the automatic tasks of the application, thanks to the built-in device functionalities. However, a computer client version of the application can be installed, too.

\subsection{User interfaces}
The user can interact with the application through several graphical interfaces:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Registration/login interface: allows the user to insert credentials in order to registering or logging into the system;

\end{figure}
\item User account interface: user can specify his profile characteristics, such as his passes, car and/or bike ownership;
\item Appointment CRUD interface: allows creating, showing and editing appointment parameters and related constraints;
\item Non-scheduled appointments interface: provides a list of all inserted appointments, but not \textbf{already} scheduled (includes the possibility to delete an item of the list);
\item Schedule interface: user can set parameters, contraints, optimization criteria and request a schedule creation for a given date;
\item Schedules result interface: shows the computation of the requested schedules for a given date and asks the user to select one, then waits for confirmations for that;
\item Schedule progress interface: permits to keep track of the completeness percentage, indicating the directions to be followed by the user in a map, in order to arrive to the next appointments;
\item Tickets/rides reservation interface: allows user to buy tickets for public travel means and/or reserve a ride for the shared travel means;
\item Appointments history interface: shows a list of archived appointments;
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Hardware interfaces}
Hardware interfaces are physical linking across which two or more separate components of a system exchange information. A hardware interface is described by the mechanical and electrical signals at the interface and the protocol for sequencing them. There are no interesting hardware interfaces in our scope.
%Our system relies on the following hardware interfaces:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Mobile device: 
%\item Server: the subsystem is based on the client-server paradigm. 
%\item Travel means: gps on taxi and shared mean
%\end{itemize}

\subsection{Software interfaces}
Software interfaces are logical linking across which two or more separate component of a system exchange information. 
\begin{itemize}
\item API: information can be exchanged through HTTP request/response;
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Communications interfaces}
Communication interfaces allows two different architectures of the system to exchange information through communication channel. These non-homogeneous component of the system can communicate thanks to the following software interfaces and protocols:
\begin{itemize}
\item Cellular connectivity: mobile devices can connect to the internet thanks to LTE standard;
\item GPS: cellular can retrieve his coordinates position through NMEA protocol;
\item QRCode: present in most of the shared means, allows to quick identify the transportation which we are near;
\end{itemize}
