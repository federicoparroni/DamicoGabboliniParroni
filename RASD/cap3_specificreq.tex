\chapter{Specific requirements}

\section{External Interface Requirements}
The application shows its best potential when running in a mobile device, for instance a smartphone or a tablet. This permits to extend the features and the automatic tasks of the application, thanks to the built-in device functionalities. However, a computer client version of the application can be installed, too.

\subsection{User interfaces}
The user can interact with the application through several graphical interfaces:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Registration/login interface}: allows the user to insert credentials in order to registering or logging into the system;
\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=250pt, keepaspectratio]{"images/interfaces/login".jpg}
\caption{Registration/login interface}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\item \textbf{User account interface}: user can specify his characteristics

\includegraphics[width=250pt, keepaspectratio]{"images/interfaces/appointment".jpg}
\caption{Appointment CRUD interface}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\item \textbf{Appointments list interface}: provides a list of all inserted appointments, with the possibility to filter between non-scheduled/scheduled ones (includes the possibility to delete an item of the list);
\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=250pt, keepaspectratio]{"images/interfaces/"appointments".jpg}
\caption{Appointments list interface}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\item \textbf{Schedules list interface}: display a list of the created schedules

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=250pt, keepaspectratio]{"images/interfaces/"schedules".jpg}
\caption{Schedules list interface}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\item \textbf{Schedule interface}: user can set parameters, contraints, optimization criteria and request a schedule creation for a given date;
\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=250pt, keepaspectratio]{"images/interfaces/"schedule".jpg}
\caption{Schedule interface}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\item \textbf{Schedules result interface}: shows the computation of the requested schedules for a given date and asks the user to select one, then waits for confirmation for that;
\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=250pt, keepaspectratio]{"images/interfaces/"scheduleresults".jpg}
\caption{Schedules result interface}
\end{center}

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=250pt, keepaspectratio]{"images/interfaces/schedule progress".jpg}
\caption{Schedule progress interface}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\item \textbf{Tickets/rides reservation interface}: allows user to buy tickets for public travel means and/or reserve a ride for the shared travel means;
%\item \textbf{Appointments history interface}: shows a list of archived appointments;
\end{enumerate}

%\subsubsection{Notes on User Interfaces}
%The interfaces displayed before have been created through the IDE Xcode. In this way, if the application will be implemented, the GUI will look like exactly as shown above.

\subsection{Hardware interfaces}
Hardware interfaces are physical linking across which two or more separate components of a system exchange information. A hardware interface is described by the mechanical and electrical signals at the interface and the protocol for sequencing them. There are no interesting hardware interfaces in our scope.
%Our system relies on the following hardware interfaces:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Mobile device: 
%\item Server: the subsystem is based on the client-server paradigm. 
%\item Travel means: gps on taxi and shared mean
%\end{itemize}

\subsection{Software interfaces}
Software interfaces are logical linking across which two or more separate applications running on a system exchange information. The most relevant software interface in our system is API. APIs are sets of subroutine definitions, protocols and clearly defined methods of communication, allowing data exchanging and service requests. There are several kinds of these:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Operating System APIs}: specify interface between applications and OS, permitting to access low level routines calls (for instance, to communicate with memory or with an internal device)
\item \textbf{Remote APIs}: DBMS expose a set of standards that the API user can adopt in order to manage the database data. SQL is the standard language for storing, manipulating and retrieving data in this context;
\item \textbf{Web API}: information can be exchanged through the internet by encapsulating it in HTTP request/response. Weather forecast, travel services, mapping systems offer this typology of API.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Communications interfaces}
Communication interfaces allows two different architectures of the system to exchange information through communication channel. These non-homogeneous components of the system can communicate thanks to the following software interfaces and protocols:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Cellular connectivity}: mobile devices can connect to the internet thanks to LTE standard;
\item \textbf{GPS}: cellular can retrieve his coordinates position through NMEA protocol;
\item \textbf{QRCode}: associates a matrix of bits to an URL. QRCodes are present in most of the shared means, semplifying the booking of that.
%identify the nearby transportation
\end{itemize}


\section{Functional requirements}
\subsection{Scenarios}

Here are some scenarios that describe the usage of the system.

\subsubsection{Scenario 1} \label{scenario:1}
Luana has some problems in scheduling his daily appointments in fact she is always late. One of her friend told her that has been released a new application Travlendar+ that can be useful for scheduling appointments. Luana decides to download it and then she registers herself to the system by submitting his e-mail and a password. After the e-mail confirmation she inserts in the system her user parameters.


\subsubsection{Scenario 2} \label{scenario:2}
Giovanni will start the fourth year of his Master's degree. Surfing the internet, he finds out that his lesson schedule for the first semester has been published. Giovanni decides to fill in the application with his new appointments related to lessons attendance. In fact he knows where to go, at which time and day and for which amount of time. Since he knows that these events will going to happen for 3 months, he sets them as recurrent.

\subsubsection{Scenario 3} \label{scenario:3}
Edoardo wants to start training but he doesn't know what are the best hours in which he can run in accord to his appointments, he know only that he can run between 5 and 7 pm, for 45 minutes. he can insert this last appointment in the application whitout specify the exactly starting hour and the system will schedule it at best.

\subsubsection{Scenario 4} \label{scenario:4}
Federico has scheduled his appointments but at lunch time his son called him because he needed a ride for go back to home. Federico decided to help his son and so he brought him home. now the current running schedule is not more valid so he request to the system a reschedule of his appointment according to his position.  


\subsubsection{Scenario 5} \label{scenario:5}
John is ready to start is daily tasks in fact he has already scheduled his appointments through Travlendar+ application. 15 minutes before the schedule starting time he recieves a notification by the application saying that there is a possible rearregment of his appointments by using shared travel means that can improve the optimization criteria selected by him. so he decides to accepts this new schedule.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Notes on diagrams}
In these diagrams we assume that the user has ran the application, but when necessary this action is explicitly specified. In particular, if the actor is a \textit{Registered User} or an \textit{External User} then we assume that the user is facing the login page. On the other hand, if the actor is a \textit{Logged User} then is assumed that it is on the home page.

\section{Performance Requirements} \label{sec:performanceRequirements}
The user must be notified in real time when a shared travel mean can be booked in order to provide a better mobility option,
since these kind of transportation can remain available for a limited amount of time.

Other performance requirements can't be easily expressed because they depends heavily on external services and on the device in which the application is run. For example the time needed to create a schedule is influenced by the promptness of the APIs.

Anyway an upper bound of 5 seconds for the creation of a schedule is given. Moreover, the position of the user during the progress of a schedule must be track with a maximum delay of 100ms.

\section{Design Constraints}

\subsection{Standard compliance}
Our system conforms to OAuth2 \footnote{Open Authentication, an industry-standard protocol for authorization. It focuses on client developer simplicity while providing specific authorization flows for web applications, desktop applications, mobile phones, and living room devices.} to handle the registration and login process. 
Moreover, HTTPS \footnote{HTTPS is a communications protocol for secure communication over a computer network. The main motivation for HTTPS is authentication of the visited website and protection of the privacy and integrity of the exchanged data.} protocol is used to guarantee secure treatment of user's sensitive data.

\subsection{Hardware limitations}
The bottleneck on the performance of the system is represented by the network infrastructure capability. In particular the most affected activity is the schedule computation.
\subsubsection{Analysis}
We can assume that the upload and download speeds of the APIs server is respectively 50Mbit/s and 150Mbit/s per client and that a request and a response weights are 20KB and 180KB.
We can consider 2 cases:
\begin{itemize}
\item 10Mbit/s and 5Mbit/s download and upload speeds respectively of the client;
\item 100Mbit/s and 50Mbit/s download and upload speeds respectively of the client.
\end{itemize}

In the first column the numbers between brackets rempresent the number $n$ of appointments with variable starting time, so that can be arranged differently relative to each other, changing their order in the schedule. Then the number of calls to External APIs that should be done is calculated, in case of a brute-force approach in the scheduling algorithm. Therefore the number of calls is proportional to $n!$.
Finally the total amount of time is calculated considering the previous assumptions.

We can realize that the number of calls to external APIs should be minimized in order to fullfill the requirement on performance expressed in \ref{sec:performanceRequirements}.

\section{Software System Attributes}

\subsection{Reliability}
The system should guarantee that from the data retrieved is always constructed the most convenient valid schedules, according to user preferences and constraints, if it exists.

\subsection{Availability}
The system should be accessible 24 hours per day and should be available 99,9\% of the time (up to 8,76 hours per year of downtime). Anyway the availability of the features involving the use of external services can't be directly controlled. In particular the availability of the feature $j$ is given by:

\begin{equation}
A_j = a_0 \prod_{i=1}^n a_i 
\end{equation} 

where each $a_i$ represent the availability of the external service $i$ used and $a_0$ is the availability of the application. For instance, in the case of a schedule creation:

\caption{A failure in one of the chain of request to the APIs causes the entire process to break down}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Security}
The identity of the user must be verified through a login phase.
User's characteristics must be protected during transmission from client to server throughout the registration. User credentials are cryptographied and then saved.
\subsection{Maintainability}
The system should be open to modifications.
In particular the application should be able to consider new travel means, new scheduling optimization criteria and new constraints.
Moreover, also the GUI should be easily editable, so that can adapt to new operating systems.

\subsection{Portability}
The system should be adaptable to run in all the devices (\ref{def:device}) considered.
