\chapter{Specific requirements}

\section{External Interface Requirements}
The application shows its best potential when run in a mobile device, for instance a smartphone or a tablet. This permits to extend the features and the automatic tasks of the application, thanks to the built-in device functionalities. However, a computer client version of the application can be installed, too.

\subsection{User interfaces}
The user can interact with the application through several graphical interfaces:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Registration/login interface: allows the user to insert credentials in order to registering or logging into the system;
\item User profile interface: user can specify his characteristics, such as his passes, car and/or bike ownership;
\item Appointment CRUD interface: allows creating, showing and editing appointment parameters and related constraints;
\item Non-scheduled appointments interface: provides a list of all inserted appointments, but not \textbf{already} scheduled (includes the possibility to delete an item of the list);
\item Schedule interface: user can set optimization criteria and request a schedule creation for a given date
\item Schedule result interface: shows the computation of the requested schedule and permits to keep track of the completeness percentage, indicating the directions to be followed by the user in a map, in order to arrive to the next appointments
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Hardware interfaces}
The system relies on several hardware architectures:
\begin{itemize}
\item Mobile device:
\item Servers: APIs
\item Travel means: gps on taxi and shared mean
\end{itemize}
