\section{Test of the implemented functionalities}
The tests has been done on the implemented functionalities declared on the ITD document released by the other team, for each of them at least on test has been carried out.

\subsection{Insertion of events and free times}

The insertion of an event can be done by clicking the button the main page of the application

\TestImage{func1/MainView}{Main page view}

the user is redirect to an event creation view with some fields to fill as shown below.

\TestImage{func1/AddEventPage}{Event Creation View}

The view has some missing graphic constraints that put the two clock picker in the middle of the view hiding the bar that made possible the selection of a travel mean for the event that is currently being created.\\
Another small issue is that the year of the selected day is wrong(is 0118 instead of 2018).\\
There isn't any check for the feasibility of the location inserted.\\
\subsubsection{Test1}
A first test has been carried out with a normal insertion of an event without free time and without repetition.
After the click of the add event button the user is redirected to the main page but the appointment has not been added,although with a change of date on the calendar (change date and after rechange on the current date) the appointment is added, as shown in the image below,probably a little problem in refreshing the view after the insertion.

\TestImage{func1/RepetitionApp}{Repetition view}

the confirm button has some missign constraints so it stay on the middle of the field for the insertion of the date.\\
After the click of the confirm button the user is redirected to the main page after the refresh of the view the appointment is visible only on the first date of the slot selected for the repetition, on the other days in which the appointment should be shown nothing has been added.
